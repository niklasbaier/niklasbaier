### 👋 Hi, I'm Niklas,
an ML / AI Engineer based in Munich with a passion for building intelligent systems end-to-end and at scale.

Currently, I’m part of the AI Engineering team at one of the biggest streaming & entertainment players in the German-speaking region of Europe, developing and scaling a langgraph-based RAG agent for content discovery serving millions of users.

My focus lies on Python, with some SQL mixed in. While I am mostly working on FastAPI backends, I have gathered some front-end experience in Python with Streamlit. Also, I am an avid advocate of using the markdown editor [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

### 🎓 Academia
I have studied a combination of Quantitative Finance & Computer Science at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). My master's thesis leveraged different Machine Learning models to forecast Corporate Earnings up to three years into the future, derive firms' implied cost of capital estimates from these forecasts, and finally formulate investment strategies that outperformed those based on financial analysts' earnings estimates.

### 📚 Learning

I'm currently studying about MLOps / LLMOps and how to effectively utilize technologies such as Docker, CI/CD pipelines, Metaflow and MLflow to build fullstack AI applications.
