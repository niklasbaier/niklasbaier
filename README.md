### Hi there 👋
I'm Niklas, an Associate ML Engineer. This is my personal repository containing some small side project of mine. I'm passionate about building end-to-end applications, especially those that leverage GenAI to deliver value, and understanding every step along the way.

### 🤖 Techstack

My focus lies on Python, with some SQL mixed in. I'm currently studying about MLOps / LLMOps and how to effectively utilize technologies such as Docker, CI/CD pipelines, Metaflow and MLflow to build fullstack AI applications. Also, I have gathered some front-end experience in Python with Streamlit.

### 🎓 Academia
I have studied a combination of Quantitative Finance & Computer Science at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).
